    "# Start-to-Finish Example: Applying Boundary Conditions in Curvilinear Coordinates for Rank-0, Rank-1, and Symmetric Rank-2 Tensors in Three Dimensions\n",
    "\n",
    "## Author: Zach Etienne\n",
    "### Formatting improvements courtesy Brandon Clark\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## This module documents and validates basic boundary condition algorithms for curvilinear coordinate systems (e.g., Spherical, Cylindrical), based on prescription in the [SENR/NRPy+ paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.07658).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction:\n",
    "Following the prescription in the [SENR/NRPy+ paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.07658), we will implement curvilinear boundary conditions for rank-0, rank-1, and symmetric rank-2 tensors in three dimensions; as this is the same dimension and highest rank needed for BSSN.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction to parity conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a vector $v^\\rho$ defined at ghostzone $(-\\rho,\\phi,z)$ ($\\rho>0$) in cylindrical coordinates. This will map to an interior point at $(\\rho,\\phi+\\pi,z)$. At this point, the direction of the $\\hat{\\rho}$ unit vector flips sign. Thus we cannot simply set the value of $v^\\rho$ to the value it possesses at interior point $(\\rho,\\phi+\\pi,z)$; that would result in a sign error. Instead we have\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "v^\\rho(-\\rho,\\phi,z)&=-v^\\rho(\\rho,\\phi+\\pi,z) \\\\\n",
    "&= \\mathbf{e}^\\rho\\left(-\\rho,\\phi,z\\right) \\cdot \\mathbf{e}^\\rho\\left(\\rho,\\phi+\\pi,z\\right)v^\\rho(\\rho,\\phi+\\pi,z),\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "where $\\mathbf{e}^\\rho\\left(\\rho,\\phi,z\\right)$ is the $\\rho$ unit vector evaluated at point $(\\rho,\\phi,z)$, and $\\mathbf{e}^\\rho\\left(-\\rho,\\phi,z\\right) \\cdot \\mathbf{e}^\\rho\\left(\\rho,\\phi+\\pi,z\\right)$ is the dot product of the two unit vectors, which must evaluate to $\\pm 1$ (i.e., the **parity**). Contrast this with scalars, which do not possess a sense of direction/parity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic algorithm for applying boundary conditions in curvilinear coordinates:\n",
    "\n",
    "At each ghost zone grid point $\\mathbf{d}_{\\rm gz}=(x_0,x_1,x_2)$, we will do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Evaluate the Cartesian coordinate $\\left(x(x_0,x_1,x_2),y(x_0,x_1,x_2),z(x_0,x_1,x_2)\\right)$, corresponding to this grid point. Then evaluate the inverse $\\mathbf{d}_{\\rm new}=\\left(x_0(x,y,z),x_1(x,y,z),x_2(x,y,z)\\right)$. \n",
    "    1. If $\\mathbf{d}_{\\rm new} \\ne \\mathbf{d}_{\\rm gz}$, then the ghost zone grid point maps to a point in the grid interior, *which is exactly the case described in the above section*. To distinguish this case from an \"outer boundary condition\", we shall henceforth refer to it variously as an application of an \"interior\", \"inner\", or \"parity\" boundary condition.\n",
    "    1. If $\\mathbf{d}_{\\rm new} \\equiv \\mathbf{d}_{\\rm gz}$, then the ghost zone grid point is on the outer boundary of the grid, and standard outer boundary conditions should be applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applying parity conditions to arbitrary-rank tensors:\n",
    "\n",
    "Above we presented the strategy for applying parity boundary conditions to a single component of a vector. Here we outline the generic algorithm for arbitrary-rank tensors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuing the discussion from the previous section, we assume $\\mathbf{d}_{\\rm new} \\ne \\mathbf{d}_{\\rm gz}$ (otherwise we would apply the *outer* boundary condition algorithm). Next suppose we are given a generic rank-$N$ tensor ($N>0$).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first component of the rank-$N$ tensor corresponds to some direction with unit vector $\\mathbf{e}^i$; e.g., $v^r$ corresponds to the $\\mathbf{e}^r$ direction. Compute the dot product of the unit vector $\\mathbf{e}^i$ evaluated at points $\\mathbf{d}_{\\rm gz}$ and $\\mathbf{d}_{\\rm new}$. Define this dot product as $P_1$ (\"$P$\" for \"parity\"):\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P_1 = \\mathbf{e}^i\\left(\\mathbf{d}_{\\rm gz}\\right) \\cdot \\mathbf{e}^i\\left(\\mathbf{d}_{\\rm new}\\right).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "1. $P_1$ will take the value of $\\pm 1$, depending on the unit-vector direction and the points $\\mathbf{d}_{\\rm gz}$ and $\\mathbf{d}_{\\rm new}$\n",
    "1. Repeat the above for the remaining components of the rank-$N$ tensor $j\\in \\{2,3,...,N\\}$, storing each $P_j$.\n",
    "1. The tensor mapping from $\\mathbf{d}_{\\rm gz}$ to $\\mathbf{d}_{\\rm new}$ for this tensor $T^{ijk...}_{mnp...}$ will be given by\n",
    "$$\n",
    "T^{ijk...}_{lmn...}(x_0,x_1,x_2)_{\\rm gz} = \\prod_{\\ell=1}^N P_\\ell T^{ijk...}_{mnp...}(x_0,x_1,x_2)_{\\rm new}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this formulation of BSSN, we only need to deal with rank-0, rank-1, and *symmetric* rank-2 tensors. Further, our basis consists of 3 directions, so there are a total of \n",
    "+ 1 parity condition (the trivial +1) for scalars (rank-0 tensors)\n",
    "+ 3 parity conditions for all rank-1 tensors (corresponding to each direction)\n",
    "+ 6 parity conditions for all *symmetric* rank-2 tensors (corresponding to the number of elements in the lower or upper triangle of a $3\\times3$ matrix, including the diagonal)\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus we must keep track of the behavior of **10 separate parity conditions**, which can be evaluated once the numerical grid has been set up, for all time."
