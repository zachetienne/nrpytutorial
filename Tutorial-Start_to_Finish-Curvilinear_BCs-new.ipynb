    "## Introduction: Applying boundary conditions in curvilinear coordinates\n",
    "$$\\label{intro}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inner versus outer boundary points\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike Cartesian coordinates, the boundaries of our grid in generic curvilinear coordinates are not all outer boundaries. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider first a computational grid in Cartesian coordinates, with $(x_0,x_1,x_2)=(x,y,z)$, that is *uniform* (i.e., with $\\Delta x$, $\\Delta y$, and $\\Delta z$ all set to constant values). This grid may extend over arbitrary coordinate ranges $x_i \\in [x_{i, \\rm min},x_{i, \\rm max}]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "By contrast, consider now a uniform grid in spherical coordinates $(x_0,x_1,x_2)=(r,\\theta,\\phi)$ with constant spacing $\\Delta r$, $\\Delta \\theta$, and $\\Delta \\phi$ between grid points in $r$, $\\theta$, and $\\phi$, respectively. Further, let's assume that these grids span all possible values of $\\theta$ and $\\phi$, with $r=0$ included in the domain. Then our spherical coordinate domains must satisfy the following relations\n",
    "\n",
    "+ $x_0 = r \\in [0,{\\rm RMAX}]$,\n",
    "+ $x_1 = \\theta \\in [0,\\pi]$, and\n",
    "+ $x_2 = \\phi \\in [-\\pi,\\pi]$. (Notice how we do not choose $x_2= \\phi \\in [0,2\\pi]$ so that our conversion from Cartesian to spherical coordinates is compatible with the output range from the ${\\rm atan2}(y,x)$ function: $\\phi={\\rm atan2}(y,x)\\in[-\\pi,\\pi]$.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that unlike Cartesian coordinates, the boundaries of this numerical grid in spherical coordinates are not all outer boundaries. For example, data stored at $\\phi=-\\pi$ will be identical to data at $\\phi=\\pi$, *regardless of $r$ or $\\theta$*. I.e., $\\phi$ satisfies *periodic* boundary conditions only. Further, $\\theta=0$ presents a more complicated boundary condition, in which points with negative $\\theta$ map to points with $|\\theta|$ but at an angle of $\\phi\\to \\phi+\\pi$. Finally, negative $r$ points will map to postive $r$ points on the other side of the origin. We call these boundaries *inner* boundaries, as they generally map to other points in the interior (as opposed to the outer boundaries) of the grid. \n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly we cannot generally apply an outer boundary condition to the inner boundaries; these boundaries will need to be treated differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "On our numerical grids, this poses some difficulty, as finite differences require that *all* boundaries of the grid be extended so that numerical derivatives can be taken at all points in the grid interior. We call the points in the extended region *ghost zones*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Numerical grids of $N$th order accuracy generally possess $N/2$ ghost zone points in the boundary regions (i.e., $x_i < x_{i,\\rm min}$ and $x_i > x_{i, \\rm max}$). While in Cartesian coordinates, these ghost zone points map to regions outside the grid domain $x_i \\in [x_{i, \\rm min},x_{i, \\rm max}]$, in spherical coordinates, most ghost zone points map to regions *inside* the grid domain. For example, for some $\\tilde{r}\\in [0,{\\rm RMAX}]$ and $\\tilde{\\theta}\\in[0,\\pi]$, the ghost zone point $(\\tilde{r},\\tilde{\\theta},2\\pi+\\Delta \\phi/2)$ would map to the interior point $(\\tilde{r},\\tilde{\\theta},\\Delta \\phi/2)$ because the $\\phi$ coordinate is periodic. Thus when given a ghost zone point in some non-Cartesian coordinate system, we are faced with the problem of addressing the following two questions:\n",
    "1. Does a given ghost point map to an interior point, or is it an outer boundary point (i.e., a point exterior to the domain)?\n",
    "1. If the ghost zone point maps to an interior point, to which interior point does it map?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dealing with vectors and tensors across inner boundaries\n",
    "\n",
    "When applying inner boundary conditions to vectors and tensors, we must consider how the direction or *parity* of vector and tensor components change across the inner boundary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a vector $v^\\rho$ defined at ghost zone $(-\\rho,\\phi,z)$ ($\\rho>0$) in cylindrical coordinates. This will map to an interior point at $(\\rho,\\phi+\\pi,z)$. At this point, the direction of the $\\hat{\\rho}$ unit vector flips sign. Thus we cannot simply set the value of $v^\\rho$ to the value it possesses at interior point $(\\rho,\\phi+\\pi,z)$; that would result in a sign error. Instead we have\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "v^\\rho(-\\rho,\\phi,z)&=-v^\\rho(\\rho,\\phi+\\pi,z) \\\\\n",
    "&= \\mathbf{e}^\\rho\\left(-\\rho,\\phi,z\\right) \\cdot \\mathbf{e}^\\rho\\left(\\rho,\\phi+\\pi,z\\right)v^\\rho(\\rho,\\phi+\\pi,z),\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "where $\\mathbf{e}^\\rho\\left(\\rho,\\phi,z\\right)$ is the $\\rho$ unit vector evaluated at point $(\\rho,\\phi,z)$, and $\\mathbf{e}^\\rho\\left(-\\rho,\\phi,z\\right) \\cdot \\mathbf{e}^\\rho\\left(\\rho,\\phi+\\pi,z\\right)$ is the dot product of the two unit vectors, which must evaluate to $\\pm 1$ (i.e., the **parity**). Contrast this with scalars, which do not possess a sense of direction/parity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Coordinate singularities\n",
    "\n",
    "Most non-Cartesian, orthogonal coordinate systems (like spherical coordinates) possess *coordinate singularities*. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, coordinate singularities in spherical coordinates lie along $\\theta=0$ and $\\theta=\\pi$; these are points where the coordinate system focuses to a single point. For example, the coordinate singularity at the North Pole is the reason why all directions are south there. Critically, these singularities manifest as points where the reference metric or its inverse crosses through zero or diverges to $\\infty$. As we derived in a [previous module](Tutorial-ScalarWaveCurvilinear.ipynb), the Laplacian in spherical polar coordinates takes the form\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\nabla^2 u = \\partial_r^2 u + \\frac{1}{r^2} \\partial_\\theta^2 u + \\frac{1}{r^2 \\sin^2 \\theta} \\partial_\\phi^2 u +  \\frac{2}{r} \\partial_r u + \\frac{\\cos\\theta}{r^2 \\sin\\theta} \\partial_\\theta u,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "which diverges at $r=0$ and $\\sin\\theta=0-$precisesly at the $\\theta=0$ and $\\theta=\\pi$ coordinate singularity. \n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid this divergence, we simply choose that our numerical grids be **cell-centered**. For example, if we choose a numerical grid with 3 outer ghost zone points (needed due to 6th-order-accurate centered finite differencing), and we want the grid interior to be sampled with ${\\rm Nr}\\times{\\rm Ntheta}\\times{\\rm Nphi}$ grid points, then the cell-centered grid points can be indexed via three *even* integers $\\left(\\rm{i0}\\in[0,{\\rm Nr}+6),\\rm{i1}\\in[0,{\\rm Ntheta}+6),\\rm{i2}\\in[0,{\\rm Ntheta}+6)\\right)$:\n",
    "+ $r_{\\rm i0}      = r_{\\rm min}      + \\left({\\rm i0} + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\Delta r$, where $r_{\\rm min}=\\left(-3+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\Delta r$;\n",
    "+ $\\theta_{\\rm i1} = \\theta_{\\rm min} + \\left({\\rm i1} + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\Delta \\theta$, where $\\theta_{\\rm min}= \\left(-3+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\Delta \\theta$; and\n",
    "+ $\\phi_{\\rm i2}   = \\phi_{\\rm min}   + \\left({\\rm i2} + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\Delta \\phi$, where $\\phi_{\\rm min}=-\\pi+ \\left(-3+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\Delta \\phi$.\n",
    "\n",
    "As Laplacians like these appear on the right-hand sides of, e.g., the scalar wave equation in curvilinear coordinates, we still have a problem of some terms becoming quite large as the coordinate singularity is approached. This issue manifests as a stiffening of the PDE, requiring that we be very careful about the precise [Method of Lines](Tutorial-Method_of_Lines-C_Code_Generation.ipynb) timestepping algorithm used. See [Cordero-Carrión & Cerdá-Durán](https://arxiv.org/abs/1211.5930) for information on dealing with this subtlety in a second-order Runge-Kutta Method of Lines context; it was later found that the standard RK4 method maintain stable solutions to PDEs affected by this sort of stiffening.\n",

    "At each ghost zone grid point $\\mathbf{d}_{\\rm gz}=(x_0,x_1,x_2)$, we will do the following:\n",

    "    1. If $\\mathbf{d}_{\\rm new} \\ne \\mathbf{d}_{\\rm gz}$, then the ghost zone grid point maps to a point in the grid interior, *which is exactly the case described in the above section*.

    "    1. If $\\mathbf{d}_{\\rm new} \\equiv \\mathbf{d}_{\\rm gz}$, then the ghost zone grid point is on the outer boundary of the grid, and standard outer boundary conditions should be applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "In detail, the algorithm is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Convert the coordinate $(x_0,x_1,x_2)$ for the ghost zone point to Cartesian coordinates $\\left(x(x_0,x_1,x_2),y(x_0,x_1,x_2),z(x_0,x_1,x_2)\\right)$. For example, if we choose ordinary spherical coordinates $(x_0,x_1,x_2)=(r,\\theta,\\phi)$, then\n",

This explains the fact that we declare many variables in `bc_struct` with the `**` prefix, denoting that these are \"pointers to pointers\". For example `outer_bc_dest_pt[0]` points to the set of ghost zone cells on the outer boundary that are in the layer of ghost zones just adjacent to the grid interior. Further, `outer_bc_dest_pt[0][0]` points to a `gz_map` containing the address `(i0,i1,i2)` on the numerical grid of \"outer boundary point zero\". Thus `outer_bc_dest_pt[0][0].i0` will contain the `i0` address of point zero on the innermost layer of ghost zones. Note that the numbering of the boundary points is rather arbitrary, but each point has a unique label, and there are no duplicates. This ensures efficiency in memory.\n",
