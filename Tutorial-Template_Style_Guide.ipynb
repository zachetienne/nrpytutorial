Within the algortihm you may refer to where source code is implemeted as a part of this module. </optional>\n",

    "The Table of Contents (ToC) plays a significant role in the formatting of your module. The above ToC is for this module, but I have constructed it in a way such that you should see all of the important details for any module you need to write. If you choose to include a preliminaries section, enumerate it with the \"0.\" All other sections, subsections, and sub-subsections can be enumerated with the 1. Jupyter/LaTex will handle there own numerbing/lettering scheme. It is important when creating subsections and sub-subsections that you indent seen in the Markdown code. The text colors vary for the level section you're assigning within the Markdown code. When writing within the brackets to specify a step number, the following scheme is to be used:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Header Sections: Step 1, Step 2, Step 3\n",
    "* Subsections: Step 1.a, Step 1.b, Step 1.c\n",

    "\n",
    "If for some reason you go more then three levels deep in your sectioning, I would suggest finding a way to reorganize your sectioning to prevent that, or ask Zach Etienne what the next level of labelling for Steps should be. We will talk about the other components within the Markdown Code for the ToC in [Step 1.a](#internal_links). The only text within the ToC section of this module should be the ToC code itself and what precedes it.\n",
    "\n",

    "https://medium.com/@sambozek/ipython-er-jupyter-table-of-contents-69bb72cf39d3\n",
    "\n",
    "The Table of Contents is a family of internal links. To link internally we first have to specify an ***anchor tag*** which is the text within the parenthese of preceded by a # (See ToC Markdown code). For instance, the anchor tag for this subsection is \"internal_links\". So, for a particular Step within the Table of Contents you specify the Step title in brackets (e.g., <font color='blue'>[Step 1.a]</font>), appended by the anchor tag in parentheses preced by a # (e.g., <font color='red'>(#internal_links)</font>), followed by a \":\" and the Step description (e.g., : Internal linking with the Jupyter notebook, Table of Contents). Look at the Markdown code for the Table of Contents for a few examples. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Note**: The anchor tags cannot be anything that you want. Anchor tags must be entirely lowercase and contain no spaces. Numbers are fine as well as underscores, but not capitalization. I suggest making the anchor tags have siginificant meaning to the section there tied to, instead of making one that reads \"step1a\". The reason I say this, is because if you ever need to resection your module, the tags won't all need to be chnaged as well if you give each one a unqiue name.  \n",
    "\n",
    "All we have done so far is establish anchor tags and clickable links within the Table of Contents, but how do we establish the link to the specific section within the module. Opening up the Markdown code for this section you will see a line of code above the title, and a line of code directly below the title. These are the answers to the question. Each section requires these components to be included for both the Jupyter notebook and LaTex internal linking. Make sure the top line of the Markdown code has a space between it and the title. Similarly, the code directly beneath the title needs  space below it as well, separated from the main body of text (see above in Markdown code).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Note**: Links do not work unless the two sections which are linked have been run.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Table of Contents is now linked to this section and you may have already noticed but this section, and all others, are linked back to the Table of Contents using the Markdown code in line at the end of the section title. This is exceedingly convenient for modules of great length. It may also be convenient when you're in a particular subsection and you wish to just return to the header section. This is accomplished using a bracket parentheses \\[\\]() pairing like so (see this in Markdown code). Go back to [Step 1](#linking)\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, you would more often than not write a code block below implementing what was discussed in this section. This isn't always necessary, some header sections plainly serve as a set up for subsections that will contain all of the necessary coding components.  "
