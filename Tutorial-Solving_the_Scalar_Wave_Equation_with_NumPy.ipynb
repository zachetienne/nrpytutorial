    "(*Note on Authors*: Zach wrote the NRPy+ infrastructure, as well as this notebook and its Python code; Patrick wrote the first version of the NRPy+-based Einstein Toolkit thorns for solving the scalar wave equation in 2018; Terrence rewrote these thorns to latest NRPy+ standards in 2020, along the lines of the [`BaikalETK` thorns](Tutorial-BaikalETK.ipynb); Thiago extended the scalar wave initial data infrastructure and contributed fixes to the original NRPy+ scalar wave notebooks; Leo created the boundary condition animation below; and Brandon established NRPy+ notebook formatting standards.)\n",

    "Thus, given initial data $u_0$ and $v_0$, we can use the above algorithm to advance the solution forward in time by one timestep, to $u_1$ and $v_1$. Recall the $\\nabla^2 u$ terms in the above expressions are computed using finite-difference derivatives. Since finite-difference derivatives require neighboring points be evaluated, we only evaluate the $k_i$'s in the interior of the grid; at each step we apply boundary conditions to fill in the outermost neighboring points (called ghost zones)."
